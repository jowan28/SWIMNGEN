# SWIMSEG_PLUS
ML techniques have been used to create SWIMNGEN, a generative model that can be sampled to get 'extra' images from the SWIMSEG and SWINSEG datasets.

Folders SWIMSEG_PLUS and SWINSEG_PLUS contain augmented datasets of each, with their cloud maps.

The paper included walks through the process of augmenting the data and making SWIMNGEN.
